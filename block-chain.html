          <p>
            The block chain provides Bitcoin’s public ledger, an ordered and
            timestamped record of transactions. This system is used to protect
            against double spending and modification of previous transaction
            records.
          </p>
          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Each full node in the Bitcoin
            <a href="#p2p-network">network</a> independently stores a block
            chain containing only blocks validated by that node. When several
            nodes all have the same blocks in their block chain, they are
            considered to be in consensus. The validation rules these nodes
            follow to maintain consensus are called consensus rules. This
            section describes many of the consensus rules used by Bitcoin Core.

            The illustration above shows a simplified version of a block chain.
            A block of one or more new transactions is collected into the
            transaction data part of a block. Copies of each transaction are
            hashed, and the hashes are then paired, hashed, paired again, and
            hashed again until a single hash remains, the merkle root of a
            merkle tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            The merkle root is stored in the block header. Each block also
            stores the hash of the previous block’s header, chaining the blocks
            together. This ensures a transaction cannot be modified without
            modifying the block that records it and all following blocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transactions are also chained together. Bitcoin wallet software
            gives the impression that satoshis are sent from and to wallets, but
            bitcoins really move from transaction to transaction. Each
            transaction spends the satoshis previously received in one or more
            earlier transactions, so the input of one transaction is the output
            of a previous transaction.
